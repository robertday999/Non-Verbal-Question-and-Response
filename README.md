# Non-Verbal-Question-and-Response

This project is aimed at helping students who are non-verbal or have limited verbal abilities to express their preferences. The goal is to provide students with a list of options they can say "yes" or "no" to.

The engine behind this project will be GPT-3, making it possible for special education teachers without programming knowledge to create options for their students. With the help of a classroom aide, students will be able to make their preferences known on a project.
